# Introduction

I attended App Academy. Before graduation, students are required to submit and present a capstone project, which is a fullstack web application that is meant to showcase your newfound skills as a software engineer. My capstone project was a pixel-perfect clone of Reddit that I named 'Ribbit'.

After graduation, I continued to enhance Ribbit, and implementing a live chat feature using WebSockets was one of the exciting additions on my to-do list. Recently, I finally found myself in the position to tackle this feature and was successful, so I decided to share my experience with you. From initial reseasrch and planning to implementation, I will guide you through the steps involved in duplicating an existing feature. Please note that this blog post assumes a basic understanding of the languages and technologies used in the project, which include React, Redux, Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, and React-Router. However, the project also uses flask-socketio, which I will be going into detail about.
