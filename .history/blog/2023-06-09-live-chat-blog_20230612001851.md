# Live Chat Blog

I attended App Academy. Before graduation, students are required to submit and present a capstone project, which is a fullstack web application that is meant to showcase your newfound skills as a software engineer. My capstone project was a pixel-perfect clone of Reddit that I named 'Ribbit'.

After graduation, I continued to enhance Ribbit, and implementing a live chat feature using WebSockets was one of the exciting additions on my to-do list. Recently, I finally found myself in the position to tackle this feature and was successful, so I decided to share my experience with you. From initial reseasrch and planning to implementation, I will guide you through the steps involved in duplicating an existing feature. Please note that this blog post assumes a basic understanding of the languages and technologies used in the project, which include React, Redux, Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, and React-Router. However, the project also uses flask-socketio, which I will be going into detail about.

## Initial Research and Planning

Before diving into any project, it is crucial to spend time on research and planning. This stage sets the foundation for a successful implementation and ensures high-quality code. In this case, I started by thoroughly examining Reddit's live chat feature, paying attention to its functionality and user experience.

To illustrate the feature's intricacies, I created a GIF demonstrating its different aspects. Let's take a closer look and identify the key elements:

Some noteworthy observations:

- The chat window consists of two main sections: the left side containing chat navigation and a "Create Chat" button, and the right side displaying the chat thread title, messages, and an input box.
- Chat navigation buttons provide relevant information such as the other user's image, username, the last message's content, the time it was sent, and the sender (either the other user's username or "You").
- Instead of displaying emoji stickers, the last message shows a picture emoji (üñºÔ∏è).
- Messages are grouped by date, with messages sent more than a day ago displaying the abbreviated date, and messages sent yesterday or today labeled as such.
- Each chat thread begins with an area containing the other user's image, username, karma count, and the number of days they have been on the site.

- When a user sends multiple messages in a row within a minute, they are grouped together, omitting redundant information.
- Hovering over a grouped message reveals the time it was sent.
- Each message has buttons that appear on hover, allowing reactions or specific actions like deleting or reporting a message.
- Deleting a message updates its content to "[message deleted]" and changes the text color to light gray.

- Clicking the "Create Chat" button opens a "New Chat" overlay where users can search and select other users to start a chat.
- The input box expands to show four lines and then allows scrolling.

- When users without any existing chat threads open the chat feature, they see a "Welcome" overlay with a "Start new chat" button that leads to the "New Chat" overlay when clicked.

By studying these details, we gain a comprehensive understanding of the feature and can ensure a faithful recreation.

## Backend: Models and Routes

When working on a full-stack project, I prefer starting with the backend and then proceeding to the frontend. This approach minimizes the need to switch back and forth between the two and ensures smoother development. Although some backend adjustments may be necessary later, completing most of the backend work upfront allows me to focus solely on the frontend when the time comes.

### Models

To begin, let's consider the necessary database tables based on user actions:

1. Creating a new chat thread by clicking the "Create Chat" button.
2. Sending messages through the input box.
3. Clicking on a chat navigation button to open the respective thread.
4. "Deleting" a message by updating its content.

All interactions are with either the chat threads themselves or with messages, which makes it clear that we need to include two models: `ChatThread` and `ChatMessage`.

In addition, we have a many-to-many relationship between users and chat threads (chat threads can have many users, and users can have many chat threads), so we'll need an association table that we'll call `user_chat_threads`.

As a quick side note, some of the code snippets in this blog post have an import statement at the top that says `from .db import db`. To clear up any potential confusion, this is referring to the `db.py` file, which holds the following code:

```python
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
import os
environment = os.getenv("FLASK_ENV")
db = SQLAlchemy()
```

Let's begin with the `user_chat_threads` table to establish the relationship between users and chat threads:

```python
from .db import db

user_chat_threads = db.Table('user_chat_threads',
  db.Model.metadata,
  db.Column('user_id', db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('users.id'), primary_key=True),
  db.Column('chat_thread_id', db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('chat_message_threads.id'), primary_key=True),
)
```

Next, we have the `ChatThread` model to represent a chat thread between two users.

```python
from .db import db

# ...

class ChatThread(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "chat_threads"

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, server_default.db.func.now())
    messages = db.relationship('ChatMessage', back_populates='chat_message_thread', cascade='all, delete')
    chat_thread_users = db.relationship('User', back_populates='chat_threads', secondary=user_chat_threads, lazy='joined')
```

- `id` - Primary key for the chat thread
- `created_at` - Timestamp indicating when the chat thread was created
- `messages` - One-to-many relationship with the `ChatMessage` model to represent the messages in the thread. `cascade='all, delete'` ensures that when the chat thread is deleted, its messages get deleted, too.
- `chat_thread_users` - Many-to-many relationship with the `User` model to associate the users participating in the chat thread. Note the user of the `secondary` argument, which associates the `user_chat_threads` table.

Finally, we have the `ChatMessage` model:

```python
from .db import db

# ...

class ChatMessage(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "chat_messages"

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    sender_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('users.id', ondelete="CASCADE"), nullable=False)
    receiver_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("users.id"), nullable=False)
    content = db.Column(db.String(10000), nullable=False)
    thread_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("chat_message_threads.id"), unique=False, nullable=False)
    read = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False, nullable=False)
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, server_default=db.func.now())

    chat_message_thread = db.relationship('ChatMessageThread', back_populates="messages")
    sender = db.relationship("User", back_populates="user_chat_messages", primaryjoin="User.id==ChatMessage.sender_id")
    recipient = db.relationship("User", primaryjoin="User.id==ChatMessage.receiver_id")
```

- `id` - Primary key for the chat message.
- `sender_id` - The user id for user sending the message.
- `receiver_id` - The user id for the user receiving the message.
- `content` - The contents of the message.
- `thread_id` - The id of the chat thread the message belongs to.
- `read` - A boolean indicating whether or not the message has been seen, or "read", for the purposes of notifications.
- `created_at` - The timestamp of when the message was sent.
- `chat_message_thread` - One-to-many relationship with the `ChatThread` model to represent...well, the thread that the messages belong to, I guess.
- `sender` -
- `recipient` -

### Routes

With our models designed and written, we can move on to our endpoints. We can refer to the same list of actions that we referenced in the previous section to help us figure out what endpoints we need:

1. Creating a new chat thread by clicking the "Create Chat" button.
2. Sending messages through the input box.
3. Clicking on a chat navigation button to open the respective thread.
4. "Deleting" a message by updating its content.

Let's start with our import statements.

```python
from flask import Blueprint, request
from flask_login import login_required, current_user
from app.models import db, User, ChatThread, ChatMessage
```

- From `flask`:

  - `Blueprint` - Used to add views to our route using the `route` decorator
  - `request` - Contains the data that the client has sent to our app

- From `flask_login`:

  - `login_required` - Restricts views to logged-in users
  - `current_user` - Access to the logged-in user

- From `app.models`: The models that we reference within our routes (`db`, `User`, `ChatThread`, `ChatMessage`).

Following this, we need to name our route:

```python
# Import statements

# ...

chat_thread_routes = Blueprint("chat_threads", __name__)
```

Now we can use `@chat_thread_routes.route` to add our views to `chat_threads`.

Starting with our endpoints for chat threads, we need to be able to "GET" a user's threads.

```python
@chat_thread_routes.route("")
def get_user_chats():
    user = User.query.get(current_user.get_id())
    if user is not None:
        user_chats = user.chat_threads
        return { "ChatThreads": [ chat.to_dict() for chat in user_chats]}
    else:
        return { "message": "error" }
```

Here, we find the logged-in user using `current_user.get_id()`, which literally gets the id of the current user, and querying our User model with it.

Then we say that if `user` exists (`is not None`), we need to return the user's chat threads, which are held in `user.chat_threads`. The return statement turns each chat thread into a dictionary (`chat.to_dict()`) so that we may use its properties.

If `user` does not exist, we return a simple error message.

Next, it would be handy to be able to get a specific chat thread by its id, so let's write an endpoint that can do just that.

```python
# 3. Clicking on a chat navigation button to open the respective thread.
@chat_thread_routes.route("/<int:id>")
def get_user_chat(id):
    chat = ChatThread.query.get(id)
    if chat is not None:
        return chat.to_dict()
    else:
        return {"message": "Chat not found"}
```

This time, we find a specific chat thread by grabbing its id, which is stored as a parameter in the route. If a chat thread with that id exists, we return it as a dictionary, and if not, we return a "Chat not found" message.

Our final chat thread-related endpoint allows us to create chat threads using `POST`.

```python
# 1. Creating a new chat thread by clicking the "Create Chat" button.
@chat_thread_routes.route("", methods=["POST"])
@login_required
def create_thread():
    data = request.get_json()
    receiver = User.query.get(data.get("receiverId"))
    sender = User.query.get(current_user.get_id())

    thread = ChatMessageThread()
    receiver.chat_threads.append(thread)
    sender.chat_threads.append(thread)

    db.session.add(thread)
    db.session.commit()


    return { "chatThread": thread.to_dict() }
```

We are utilizing the `@login_required` decorator here, because users who aren't logged in shouldn't be able to create chat threads.

We are also utilizing the `request` object - specifically, the `get_json()` method, which parses the incoming JSON request data and returns it so we may reference it.

For example, after setting `request.get_json()` to a variable called `data`, when we write the code `data.get("receiverId")`, this is literally the receiver's id, which we set to the `receiverId` variable in the frontend before converting it to JSON.

- `receiver = User.query.get(data.get("receiverId"))` - We find the receiver by their user id and set it to the `receiver` variable
- `sender = User.query.get(current_user.get_id())` - Once again, we find the current user by using `current_user.get_id()`, and we set it to the `sender` variable.
- `thread = ChatThread()` - We create our chat thread. We don't need any information inside the parentheses for this particular model.
- `receiver.chat_threads.append(thread)` - Remember the `chat_threads` field that we gave the `User` model earlier? We append our newly-created thread to it so that the receiving user now has that thread.
- `sender.chat_threads.append(thread)` - We do the same for the sending user.
- `db.session.add(thread)` - Our new thread is added to the database...
- `db.session.commit()` - and committed.

We finish off this endpoint by returning a dictionary form of our chat thread.

We now move on to the endpoints for chat messages. Just like with chat threads, we need to be able to create a message with `POST`, but we'll also simultaneously add the message to its chat thread.

```python
# 2. Sending messages through the input box.
@chat_thread_routes.route("/<int:id>/messages", methods=["POST"])
@login_required
def create_message(id):
    data = request.get_json()

    message = ChatMessage(
        content=data.get("content"),
        sender_id=current_user.get_id(),
        receiver_id = data.get("receiver_id"),
        thread_id = id
    )

    chat_thread = ChatMessageThread.query.get(id)
    chat_thread.messages.append(message)

    db.session.add(message)
    db.session.commit()

    return message.to_dict()
```

We've already discussed what the `@login_required` decorator and the `data = request.get_json()` line do, so let's move right along.

```python
message = ChatMessage(
  content=data.get("content"),
  sender_id=current_user.get_id(),
  receiver_id = data.get("receiver_id"),
  thread_id = id
)
```

Here, we create our new message, passing along the following parameters:

- `content=data.get("content")` - Our message's content
- `sender_id=current_user.get_id()` - We set the sender's id to the current user's id, since they will always be one in the same.
- `receiver_id=data.get("receiver_id")` - We get the receiver's id from data
- `thread_id=id` - Our thread id comes directly from the route.

```python
chat_thread = ChatMessageThread.query.get(id)
chat_thread.messages.append(message)

db.session.add(message)
db.session.commit()

return message.to_dict()
```

Following that, we simply find the correct chat thread by its id, append our new message to the chat thread's `messages` property, add the message to the database, commit, and finally, return a dictionary version of our message.

We've covered most of our "actions" list, but there is one more action to do: "deleting" a message.

```python
# 4. "Deleting" a message by updating its content.
@chat_thread_routes.route("/messages/<int:id>", methods=["PUT"])
@login_required
def fake_delete_message(id):
    message = ChatMessage.query.get(id)
    setattr(message, "content", "[Message deleted]")

    db.session.commit()
    return message.to_dict()
```

Since this is just an update, we use `PUT` - and more specifically, the `setattr()` method, which is a Python function that sets the value of the specified attribute; or, in other words, changes the value of the `"content"` attribute of the `message` to `"[Message deleted]"`.

We commit this change to the database and return our message as a dictionary.

----------------

## WebSockets Backend

Our last backend task is to create the `flask-socketio` endpoints needed to turn our chat feature into a live chat feature.

We create a new file, `socket.py`, which lives in the general `app/` folder instead of `api/`. In this file, we handle the entirety of the backend code needed to implement WebSockets.

First, we handle our imports.

```python
# socket.py

from flask_socketio import SocketIO, emit, join_room, leave_room
from app.models import db, User, ChatMessage
from flask_login import current_user
from flask import request

import os
```

We covered the majority of these statements in the last section, but there are a couple of new ones to discuss.

* From `flask_socketio`:
  * `SocketIO` - Needed to initialize our socket instance
  * `emit` -
