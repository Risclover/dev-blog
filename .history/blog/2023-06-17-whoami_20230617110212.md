Welcome to Ramblings of a Software Engineer! I am Sara, your hostess this evening and the author of this blog.

I plan on this being a public personal blog about all things to do with being a dev: what I'm doing as a dev, dev-related thoughts and opinions, teaching dev-related concepts, that sort of thing.

I am a software engineer from Califorina with a severe passion for software engineering. After discovering this passion, I was ecstatic - I'd _finally_ found what I want to do for work for the rest of my life, and to get paid doing what you love is the dream. During my free time, there's a large possibility that I can be found at my computer, either studying and learning or working on a project.

I started my development journey as a frontend engineer. After self-studying various frontend languages and technologies for about a year, I decided to attend App Academy for some fullstack training, and graduated in February.
