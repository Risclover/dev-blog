# Live Chat Blog

In today's fast-paced online community landscape, real-time interaction has become the lifeblood of user engagement. As the creator and developer of Ribbit, a pixel-perfect clone of Reddit, I knew that replicating the captivating experience offered by such a popular platform was paramount. Join me on an exhilarating journey as we take a deep dive into the code that powers Ribbit's live chat feature. From the intricacies of server-side implementation to the enchanting client-side magic, we'll explore the inner workings of this feature in the hopes that you can either better understand how to clone an existing feature, or use what I've learned to implement a live chat feature yourself.

Ribbit initially began as my capstone project, a requirement for my graduation from App Academy, the software engineering bootcamp I enrolled in last fall. Following my graduation, I wholeheartedly dedicated myself to enhancing Ribbit, aspiring to transform it into a comprehensive replica of Reddit. Over time, it evolved into a fully-fledged application. My long-standing ambition of integrating a live chat feature within Ribbit finally came to fruition just last week, and I am excited to break down and discuss this process in detail.

It's important to note that this blog post assumes a basic understanding of the languages and technologies employed in the project. These include React, Redux, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and React-Router. Furthermore, the project utilizes flask-socketio, a technology we'll explore in greater detail.

## Initial Research and Planning

Before diving into any project, it is crucial to spend time on research and planning. This stage sets the foundation for a successful implementation and ensures high-quality code. In this case, I started by thoroughly examining Reddit's live chat feature, paying attention to its functionality and user experience.

To illustrate the feature's intricacies, I created a GIF demonstrating its different aspects. Let's take a closer look and identify the key elements:

Some noteworthy observations:

- The chat window consists of two main sections: the left side containing chat navigation and a "Create Chat" button, and the right side displaying the chat thread title, messages, and an input box.
- Chat navigation buttons provide relevant information such as the other user's image, username, the last message's content, the time it was sent, and the sender (either the other user's username or "You").
- Instead of displaying emoji stickers, the last message shows a picture emoji (🖼️).
- Messages are grouped by date, with messages sent more than a day ago displaying the abbreviated date, and messages sent yesterday or today labeled as such.
- Each chat thread begins with an area containing the other user's image, username, karma count, and the number of days they have been on the site.

- When a user sends multiple messages in a row within a minute, they are grouped together, omitting redundant information.
- Hovering over a grouped message reveals the time it was sent.
- Each message has buttons that appear on hover, allowing reactions or specific actions like deleting or reporting a message.
- Deleting a message updates its content to "[message deleted]" and changes the text color to light gray.

- Clicking the "Create Chat" button opens a "New Chat" overlay where users can search and select other users to start a chat.
- The input box expands to show four lines and then allows scrolling.

- When users without any existing chat threads open the chat feature, they see a "Welcome" overlay with a "Start new chat" button that leads to the "New Chat" overlay when clicked.

By studying these details, we gain a comprehensive understanding of the feature and can ensure a faithful recreation.
