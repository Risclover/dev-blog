## Introduction

For those who don't know, Ribbit is the name of the Internet's best pixel-perfect Reddit clone. It is also the result of my App Academy capstone project. After graduation, I continued to work on improving and expanding the site, implementing several features and learning a lot about optimization in the progress (note to self: don't add 200 seeds out of nowhere). Implementing a live chat feature with WebSockets is something I've wanted to do since before writing Ribbit's first line of code, and it's been waiting patiently on my Features To Do list while I worked on the features ahead of it in line.

Last weekend, I found myself in the position to finally give WebSockets and the live chat feature a shot. I worked hard throughout the weekend, my excitement fueling my motivation. It was truly a pleasant surprise that I found myself finishing the feature before the weekend was over.

In this blog post, I'm going to go through the process of duplicating Reddit's live chat feature, from the initial planning process all the way to the end. Please note that this post will _not_ include information on the languages and technologies used to build this feature; if you wish to use this blog post to help yourself out in some way, you will most likely need to already have an understanding of the languages and technologies listed below. If, however, you don't have an issue with said languages but you do find yourself struggling to understand how to do things like duplicating an existing feature or figuring out how to model a feature's backend and/or frontend, or if you're just plain interested in reading how I did this, this post may be of use to you.

(Note: I do briefly go over WebSockets - more specifically, `flask-socketio` at some point, so if you are here to learn more about that, it's the one technology I end up covering.)

### Languages and Technologies

## Initial Research and Planning

Whenever I begin a new project or feature, I usually spend some time in the planning/research stage. It can be easy to underestimate how important this stage is, but a well thought-out project almost always ends up being simpler to execute with higher-quality code.

Since we're cloning something that already exists, a great place to start is, well, the thing that already exists - in our case, Reddit's live chat feature. For simplicity's sake, I went ahead and captured a gif of me interacting with the chat window. Let's watch this gif and look for small details we want to take note of - how the feature works, how parts interact with other parts, little things that make the feature better, etc.

(gif)

For example, right away I see that the chat window is broken up into two main parts - the left side, which contains the chat navigation and a "Create Chat" button, and the right side, which contains the chat thread title, the chat thread itself (and the messages it contains), and the input box area.

The following list is of more things to take notice of. Note that when I first worked on this feature, I certainly didn't notice all of these things at once; however, it makes more sense to just list these all up front so that you know ahead of time some things to keep in mind.

- The chat navigation buttons are labeled with various pieces of information; more specifically, the other user's image and username, as well as the contents of the last message sent, the time the last message was sent, and who sent the message (the user's username of it was the other user, or "You" if it was the current user).
  - One thing to note is that when an emoji sticker is sent, rather than showing the emoji sticker as the last message sent, the button merely shows a picture emoji (üñºÔ∏è).
  - Another thing to note: If the message was sent more than a day ago, the time is replaced by the abbreviated date of the day it was sent.
- The thread title is the other user's username.
- There are tons of details in the messages area:
  - At the very top of the chat thread is an area with a decent amount of white space and some information about the other user, including their image, their username, their karma count, and the number of days they've been on the site.
  - Messages are grouped by date.
    - Messages sent the day before yesterday and beyond show the abbreviated date.
    - Messages sent yesterday are grouped under 'Yesterday', and today's are grouped under 'Today'.
  - Messages are _usually_ labeled with the sending user's username and image, as well as the time the message was sent.
    - When one user sends multiple messages in a row:
      - Messages sent within a minute of the message before it are grouped together with that message. Except for the first message in a group, grouped messages don't have the user's information or the time sent on display, which gives the impression that the messages belong together.
        - Hovering over a "grouped" message reveals the time it was sent.
  - Speaking of hovering: All messages have a little container containing two buttons that appears when hovering over the message.
    - The first button is the "Reactions" button, which adds a reaction to the message.
    - As for the second button, if the message is the current user's, this button contains a trash can icon and when clicked, "deletes" the message (more on this shortly). However, if the message is the other user's, this button contains a flag icon and when clicked, reports the message to Reddit moderators.
  - Clicking the button with the trash can icon doesn't actually delete the message in the traditional sense. When clicked, a delete confirmation overlay appears asking the user if they're sure they want to delete the message. If the user decides to continue, rather than deleting the message, the message's content is updated so that the text is replaced with `[message deleted]`. The text's color also changes to a light grey.
