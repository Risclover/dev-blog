## Introduction

For those who don't know, Ribbit is the name of the Internet's best pixel-perfect Reddit clone. It is also the result of my App Academy capstone project. After graduation, I continued to work on improving and expanding the site, implementing several features and learning a lot about optimization in the progress (note to self: don't add 200 seeds out of nowhere). Implementing a live chat feature with WebSockets is something I've wanted to do since before writing Ribbit's first line of code, and it's been waiting patiently on my Features To Do list while I worked on the features ahead of it in line.

Last weekend, I found myself in the position to finally give WebSockets and the live chat feature a shot. I worked hard throughout the weekend, my excitement fueling my motivation. It was truly a pleasant surprise that I found myself finishing the feature before the weekend was over.

In this blog post, I'm going to go through the process of duplicating Reddit's live chat feature, from the initial planning process all the way to the end. Please note that this post will _not_ include information on the languages and technologies used to build this feature; if you wish to use this blog post to help yourself out in some way, you will most likely need to already have an understanding of the languages and technologies listed below. If, however, you don't have an issue with said languages but you do find yourself struggling to understand how to do things like duplicating an existing feature or figuring out how to model a feature's backend and/or frontend, or if you're just plain interested in reading how I did this, this post may be of use to you.

(Note: I do briefly go over WebSockets - more specifically, `flask-socketio` at some point, so if you are here to learn more about that, it's the one technology I end up covering.)

## Initial Research and Planning

Whenever I begin a new project or feature, I usually spend some time in the planning/research stage. It can be easy to underestimate how important this stage is, but a well thought-out project almost always ends up being simpler to execute with higher-quality code.

Since we're cloning something that already exists, a great place to start is, well, the thing that already exists - in our case, Reddit's live chat feature. For simplicity's sake, I went ahead and captured a gif of me interacting with the chat window. Let's watch this gif and look for small details we want to take note of - how the feature works, how parts interact with other parts, little things that make the feature better, etc.

<p align="center"><img src="../6ek5EavVy4.gif" /></p>

For example, right away I see that the chat window is broken up into two main parts - the left side, which contains the chat navigation and a "Create Chat" button, and the right side, which contains the chat thread title, the chat thread itself (and the messages it contains), and the input box area.

The following list is of more things to take notice of. Note that when I first worked on this feature, I certainly didn't notice all of these things at once; however, it makes more sense to just list these all up front so that you know ahead of time some things to keep in mind.

- The chat navigation buttons are labeled with various pieces of information; more specifically, the other user's image and username, as well as the contents of the last message sent, the time the last message was sent, and who sent the message (the user's username of it was the other user, or "You" if it was the current user).

<p align="center"><img src="../Screenshot%202023-06-10%20162355.png" /></p>

- One thing to note is that when an emoji sticker is sent, rather than showing the emoji sticker as the last message sent, the button merely shows a picture emoji (üñºÔ∏è).

<p align="center"><img src="../Screenshot%202023-06-10%20162407.png" /></p>

- Another thing to note: If the message was sent more than a day ago, the time is replaced by the abbreviated date of the day it was sent.
- The thread title is the other user's username.
- There are tons of details in the messages area:

  - At the very top of the chat thread is an area with a decent amount of white space and some information about the other user, including their image, their username, their karma count, and the number of days they've been on the site.

  <p align="center"><img src="../Screenshot%202023-06-10%20162425.png" /></p>

  - Messages are grouped by date.
    - Messages sent the day before yesterday and beyond show the abbreviated date.
    - Messages sent yesterday are grouped under 'Yesterday', and today's are grouped under 'Today'.
  - Messages are _usually_ labeled with the sending user's username and image, as well as the time the message was sent.

  <p align="center"><img src="../Screenshot%202023-06-10%20160252.png" /></p>

  - When one user sends multiple messages in a row:
    - Messages sent within a minute of the message before it are grouped together with that message. Except for the first message in a group, grouped messages don't have the user's information or the time sent on display, which gives the impression that the messages belong together.

    <p align="center">


      - Hovering over a "grouped" message reveals the time it was sent.
  - Speaking of hovering: All messages have a little container containing two buttons that appears when hovering over the message.
    - The first button is the "Reactions" button, which adds a reaction to the message.
    - As for the second button, if the message is the current user's, this button contains a trash can icon and when clicked, "deletes" the message (more on this shortly). However, if the message is the other user's, this button contains a flag icon and when clicked, reports the message to Reddit moderators.
  - Clicking the button with the trash can icon doesn't actually delete the message in the traditional sense. When clicked, a delete confirmation overlay appears asking the user if they're sure they want to delete the message. If the user decides to continue, rather than deleting the message, the message's content is updated so that the text is replaced with `[message deleted]`. The text's color also changes to a light grey.

- When the 'Create Chat' button is clicked, the 'New Chat' overlay opens.
  - The New Chat overlay contains an input box for typing usernames into. If a username matches, the user appears in the space below the input box.
    - Clicking on the user adds the user to a list held within the same input box. This makes sense for Reddit since they allow group chats; however, for now, I'm just doing private chats between two users, so I'm going to change this to just checking off the checkbox on the right when a user is selected.
    - When a user is selected, the 'Start Chat' button becomes enabled.
      - Clicking this button either
        a) starts a new thread between the current user and the selected user and opens the "Invite" overlay with an invitation to send a message, or
        b) if a thread already exists, opens the existing thread instead.
- If a user doesn't have any existing chat threads, when they open the chat feature, they are greeted with the "Welcome" overlay:

<p align="center"><img src="../welcome-overlay.png" /></p>

The 'Start new chat' button is identical to the 'Create chat' button that exists in the bottom left corner - clicking it closes the Welcome overlay and opens the New Chat overlay.

- When typing in the input box, notice that the input box expands for 4 lines and then stops and allows a scrollbar to take over. This is important to note because `input` boxes and `textarea` elements don't have a standard way of behaving like this, so we'll need to figure out a way to do this when we reach that point.

That is quite the list of details, isn't it? This just goes to show you how much detail goes into a feature like this, so it's important that we take care to ensure that all of the various parts work well together.

With that out of the way, we can move on to writing some actual code!

## Backend: Models and Routes

When I begin to code a fullstack project/feature, I always start with the backend and then move on to the frontend when done. While it's typical to have to visit the backend again every now and then, completing as much of it as possible before moving on to the frontend prevents a need to hop back and forth constantly. When the backend is (mostly) done, I can focus on just the frontend.

### Models

Let's start with the models. What tables do we need in our database? It's helpful to think of the actions that the user takes when interacting with the feature.

- The user can click the 'Create chat' button to create a new thread
- The user can use the input box to send a message
- Clicking on a chat navigation button retrieves the correct thread and opens it
- Clicking the trash can icon on a message "deletes" that message, but "deleting" the message is really just updating its contents to say `[message deleted]`.

From what I have here, I can see that I'm going to need two models: one for the chat threads, and one for the chat messages.

Let's think about our database relationships for a moment. The relationship between threads and messages is one-to-many - a thread has many messages, but messages belong to just one thread.

What about the relationship between users and chat threads?

Since chat threads have multiple (well, _two_) users and users can have many chat threads, the relationship is many-to-many. To achieve a many-to-many relationship between two tables, we'll need to create an association table with two foreign keys - one for `users` and one for `chat_threads`.

In addition, when we create our `ChatThread` model, we need to remember to assign the `secondary` attribute to the property representing the thread's users.

#### `user_chat_threads`

Let's start by creating our association table and get it out of the way.

```python
from .db import db

user_chat_threads = db.Table('user_chat_threads',
  db.Model.metadata,
  db.Column('user_id', db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('users.id'), primary_key=True),
  db.Column('chat_thread_id', db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('chat_message_threads.id'), primary_key=True),
)
```

#### ChatThread

Next, we create the `ChatThread` model.

In terms of properties, `ChatThread` needs references to the messages in the chat thread and the thread's users. We can also create a `createdAt` property, in case we ever need to reference a chat thread's creation timestamp.

```python
from .db import db

# user_chat_threads table

class ChatThread(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "chat_threads"

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, server_default.db.func.now())

    # ...
```

The thread's messages property (which we'll call `messages`, as crazy as that sounds) needs to reference the one-to-many relationship between threads and messages. We can accomplish this by using `db.relationship()` instead of `db.Column()`, and setting `back_populates='chat_message_thread'` (which I'll explain further shortly). We'll also add `cascade='all, delete'`, which essentially says "if the chat thread is deleted, the messages should be deleted, too".

```python
from .db import db

# user_chat_threads table

class ChatThread(db.Model):

  # ...

  messages = db.relationship('ChatMessage', back_populates='chat_message_thread', cascade='all, delete')
```

Lastly, the thread's users property (which we'll call `chat_thread_users`) needs to reference the many-to-many relationship between threads and users. Similarly to the `messages` property, we need to use `db.relationship()` and set `back_populates='chat_threads'`.

```python
from .db import db

# user_chat_threads table

class ChatThread(db.Model):

  # ...

  chat_thread_users = db.relationship('User', back_populates='chat_threads')
```

However, we aren't done yet. Remember the association table we created earlier? This is where we make sure to associate the table to this model. We also add `lazy='joined'` to the end of the line of code, which literally joins the two tables and returns the results.

```python
from .db import db

# user_chat_threads table

class ChatThread(db.Model):

  # ...

  chat_thread_users = db.relationship('User', back_populates='chat_threads', secondary=user_chat_threads, lazy='joined')
```

Altogether, we end up with this:

```python
from .db import db

# user_chat_threads table

class ChatThread(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "chat_threads"

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, server_default=db.func.now())
    messages = db.relationship('ChatMessage', back_populates='chat_message_thread', cascade='all, delete')
    chat_thread_users = db.relationship('User', back_populates='chat_threads', secondary=user_chat_threads, lazy='joined')

```

But we aren't done just yet. We are also going to make use of `__repr__()` and `to_dict()`.

```python
from .db import db

# user_chat_threads table

class ChatThread(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'chat_threads'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, server_default=db.func.now())
    messages = db.relationship('ChatMessage', back_populates='chat_message_thread', cascade='all, delete')
    chat_thread_users = db.relationship('User', back_populates='chat_threads', secondary=user_chat_threads, lazy='joined')

```

Notice that for `created_at`, we have `server_default=db.func.now()`.

- `server_default` sets the default value in the database when creating the table so that default values are handled by the database rather than the model.
- We pass `server_default` the `func.now()` function. This calls the `now()` datetime function, which is rendered as `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` in the table.
