## Introduction

For those who don't know, Ribbit is the name of the Internet's best pixel-perfect Reddit clone. It is also the result of my App Academy capstone project. After graduation, I continued to work on improving and expanding the site, implementing several features and learning a lot about optimization in the progress (note to self: don't add 200 seeds out of nowhere). Implementing a live chat feature with WebSockets is something I've wanted to do since before writing Ribbit's first line of code, and it's been waiting patiently on my Features To Do list while I worked on the features ahead of it in line.

Last weekend, I found myself in the position to finally give WebSockets and the live chat feature a shot. I worked hard throughout the weekend, my excitement fueling my motivation. It was truly a pleasant surprise that I found myself finishing the feature before the weekend was over.

In this blog post, I'm going to go through the process of duplicating Reddit's live chat feature, from the initial planning process all the way to the end. Please note that this post will _not_ include information on the languages and technologies used to build this feature; if you wish to use this blog post to help yourself out in some way, you will most likely need to already have an understanding of the languages and technologies listed below. If, however, you don't have an issue with said languages but you do find yourself struggling to understand how to do things like duplicating an existing feature or figuring out how to model a feature's backend and/or frontend, or if you're just plain interested in reading how I did this, this post may be of use to you.

(Note: I do briefly go over WebSockets - more specifically, `flask-socketio` at some point, so if you are here to learn more about that, it's the one technology I end up covering.)

### Languages and Technologies

- React
- Redux
- Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- Flask-socketio
- React-Router

## Initial Research and Planning

Before diving into any project, it is crucial to spend time on research and planning. This stage sets the foundation for a successful implementation and ensures high-quality code. In this case, I started by thoroughly examining Reddit's live chat feature, paying attention to its functionality and user experience.

To illustrate the feature's intricacies, I created a GIF demonstrating its different aspects. Let's take a closer look and identify the key elements:

Some noteworthy observations:

- The chat window consists of two main sections: the left side containing chat navigation and a "Create Chat" button, and the right side displaying the chat thread title, messages, and an input box.
- Chat navigation buttons provide relevant information such as the other user's image, username, the last message's content, the time it was sent, and the sender (either the other user's username or "You").
- Instead of displaying emoji stickers, the last message shows a picture emoji (🖼️).
- Messages are grouped by date, with messages sent more than a day ago displaying the abbreviated date, and messages sent yesterday or today labeled as such.
- Each chat thread begins with an area containing the other user's image, username, karma count, and the number of days they have been on the site.

- When a user sends multiple messages in a row within a minute, they are grouped together, omitting redundant information.
- Hovering over a grouped message reveals the time it was sent.
- Each message has buttons that appear on hover, allowing reactions or specific actions like deleting or reporting a message.
- Deleting a message updates its content to "[message deleted]" and changes the text color to light gray.

- Clicking the "Create Chat" button opens a "New Chat" overlay where users can search and select other users to start a chat.
- The input box expands to show four lines and then allows scrolling.

- When users without any existing chat threads open the chat feature, they see a "Welcome" overlay with a "Start new chat" button that leads to the "New Chat" overlay when clicked.

By studying these details, we gain a comprehensive understanding of the feature and can ensure a faithful recreation.

## Backend: Models and Routes

When working on a full-stack project, I prefer starting with the backend and then proceeding to the frontend. This approach minimizes the need to switch back and forth between the two and ensures smoother development. Although some backend adjustments may be necessary later, completing most of the backend work upfront allows me to focus solely on the frontend when the time comes.

### Models

To begin, let's consider the necessary database tables based on user actions:

1. Creating a new chat thread by clicking the "Create Chat" button.
2. Sending messages through the input box.
3. Clicking on a chat navigation button to open the respective thread.
4. "Deleting" a message by updating its content.

All interactions are with either the chat threads themselves or with messages, which makes it clear that we need to include two models: `ChatThread` and `ChatMessage`.

In addition, we have a many-to-many relationship between users and chat threads (chat threads can have many users, and users can have many chat threads), so we'll need an association table that we'll call `user_chat_threads`.

As a quick side note, some of the code snippets in this blog post have an import statement at the top that says `from .db import db`. To clear up any potential confusion, this is referring to the `db.py` file, which holds the following code:

```python
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
import os
environment = os.getenv("FLASK_ENV")
db = SQLAlchemy()
```

Let's begin with the `user_chat_threads` table to establish the relationship between users and chat threads:

```python
from .db import db

user_chat_threads = db.Table('user_chat_threads',
  db.Model.metadata,
  db.Column('user_id', db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('users.id'), primary_key=True),
  db.Column('chat_thread_id', db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('chat_message_threads.id'), primary_key=True),
)
```

Next, we have the `ChatThread` model to represent a chat thread between two users. The only information required is the thread id and the user ids of the participants. I also decided to include the `created_at` property to record the time that the chat thread was created, though this probably isn't necessary.

```python
from .db import db

# user_chat_threads table goes up here

# ...

class ChatThread(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "chat_threads"

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, server_default.db.func.now())
    messages = db.relationship('ChatMessage', back_populates='chat_message_thread', cascade='all, delete')
    chat_thread_users = db.relationship('User', back_populates='chat_threads', secondary=user_chat_threads, lazy='joined')
```

The thread's messages property (which we'll call `messages`, as crazy as that sounds) needs to reference the one-to-many relationship between threads and messages. We can accomplish this by using `db.relationship()` instead of `db.Column()`, and setting `back_populates='chat_message_thread'` (which I'll explain further shortly). We'll also add `cascade='all, delete'`, which essentially says "if the chat thread is deleted, the messages should be deleted, too".

```python
from .db import db

# user_chat_threads table

class ChatThread(db.Model):

  # ...

  messages = db.relationship('ChatMessage', back_populates='chat_message_thread', cascade='all, delete')
```

Lastly, the thread's users property (which we'll call `chat_thread_users`) needs to reference the many-to-many relationship between threads and users. Similarly to the `messages` property, we need to use `db.relationship()` and set `back_populates='chat_threads'`.

```python
from .db import db

# user_chat_threads table

class ChatThread(db.Model):

  # ...

  chat_thread_users = db.relationship('User', back_populates='chat_threads')
```

However, we aren't done yet. Remember the association table we created earlier? This is where we make sure to associate the table to this model. We also add `lazy='joined'` to the end of the line of code, which literally joins the two tables and returns the results.

```python
from .db import db

# user_chat_threads table

class ChatThread(db.Model):

  # ...

  chat_thread_users = db.relationship('User', back_populates='chat_threads', secondary=user_chat_threads, lazy='joined')
```

Altogether, we end up with this:

```python
from .db import db

# user_chat_threads table

class ChatThread(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "chat_threads"

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, server_default=db.func.now())
    messages = db.relationship('ChatMessage', back_populates='chat_message_thread', cascade='all, delete')
    chat_thread_users = db.relationship('User', back_populates='chat_threads', secondary=user_chat_threads, lazy='joined')

```

Notice that for `created_at`, we have `server_default=db.func.now()`.

- `server_default` sets the default value in the database when creating the table so that default values are handled by the database rather than the model.
- We pass `server_default` the `func.now()` function. This calls the `now()` datetime function, which is rendered as `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` in the table.

But we aren't done just yet. We are also going to make use of `__repr__()` and `to_dict()`.

```python
from .db import db

# user_chat_threads table

class ChatThread(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'chat_threads'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, server_default=db.func.now())
    messages = db.relationship('ChatMessage', back_populates='chat_message_thread', cascade='all, delete')
    chat_thread_users = db.relationship('User', back_populates='chat_threads', secondary=user_chat_threads, lazy='joined')

    def to_dict(self):
        return {
            "id": self.id,
            "messages": [msg.to_dict() for msg in self.messages],
            "users": [user.to_dict() for user in self.chat_thread_users],
            "createdAt": self.created_at,
            "updatedAt": self.updated_at
        }

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<Chat Message Thread {self.id}: {[msg.to_dict() for msg in self.messages]}>"

```

The `to_dict()` method turns our model into an object that is sent when a GET method is called, and the `__repr__()` method represents a class's objects as a string.
