# Redoing 'Tasklist App' - A Comparison Between Then and Now

Today I was going through my phone and deleting apps I haven't touched in months, and I stumbled upon one entitled "Tasklist App". I knew what this was immediately. It isn't actually a mobile app, but rather a web app that I saved to my phone's home screen that I had created shortly before joining App Academy. It was written when I was brand new to React, and, to my surprise, the end result is actually pretty well done.

I've always thought of myself as at least a little talented when it comes to software engineering. Since I enjoy programming so much, I end up putting a lot of hard work, effort, and heart into my projects, and I think it shows. Granted, I still have a lot to learn and I am in no way trying to imply that I'm in any way perfect (or even GOOD, by industry standards). However, I will admit that I think I am above average in comparison to my peers (peers meaning those with the same amount of time put into learning the same languages/frameworks).

At App Academy, for example, my projects were consistently among the top projects in my cohort. Of course, there's always someone better than you, and that holds true even when looking at just the people in my cohort. However, my projecs were easily in the top 3 - 5 projects every time.

I mention this because I opened my tasklist app expecting to see a lot of cringe-inducing problems. However, much to my surprise, this little app looks great and functions perfectly.

It's been several months since I've even looked at this project, let alone worked on it, and I've decided to challenge myself in creating a new tasklist app. I think it will be fun to compare the code, my methods of creation, and the final result. It's a bit of a perfect opportunity anyway because I need to work with TypeScript and Jest in order to better learn them.

Looking at Tasklist App's code, I see that I had started to try to separate my code into components, but my `App.js` file is 520 lines of code long.

## Initial Plans

For my new tasklist app, I'm going to include a backend as well as a frontend. My plan is to make it a legitimate app that people can use, which means users can sign up for their own accounts, and data will be going to an actual database instead of relying on LocalStorage.

### Tech Stack

I really enjoy using both Express and Flask, but I think for this project I'm going to go with Flask. So my tech stack, as of now, includes:

- React (TypeScript)
- Redux
- Flask (Python)
- Sqlalchemy
- React Testing Library
- Jest

### Database Schema Diagram

Since I'm going to be making this a fullstack app, I need to consider my database schema. For now, this is what I have come up with. We have a table for users, a table for projects, and a table for tasks.

#### Users

- `username` - the user's username
- `password` - the user's password
- `email` - the user's email address

#### Projects

- `user_id` - Each project will belong to a specific user, which is how we will identify which tasks belong to a user as well (because tasks must belong to a project).
- `title` - Projects must have a title, with a max of 20 characters.

#### Tasks

- `project_id` - Each task will belong to a specific project.
- `title` - The task itself.
- `description` - (called 'Notes' in the original app) The user can (optionally) use this to include additional information.
- `due_date` - The user can optionally set a due date.
- `important` - A boolean for whether or not the task is marked as 'important'.
- `completed` - A boolean for whether or not the task is marked as 'completed'.
- `priority` - (not included in the image) The level of priority the user has given the task.

### Tentative Extras

When I built the original app, I had plans to include more features than what I ended up with. More specifically, I really wanted to allow the user to select a **theme** and an **icon** for each project. I also was considering the inclusion of **subtasks** (tasks for each task, essentially).

If it isn't apparent yet, allow me to be transparent: I was modeling my app after Microsoft's To-Do app, which, when you know to compare the two, becomes somewhat obvious, what with how mine is laid out compared to Microsoft's. Anyway, since their app included themes, icons, and subtasks, I wanted mine to as well, not just for the sake of copying them but because I liked the ideas and I'm always down to make my apps feel as complete as possible.
