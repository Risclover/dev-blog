# Live Chat Blog

## Introduction

For those who don't know, Ribbit is the name of the Internet's best pixel-perfect Reddit clone. It is also the result of my App Academy capstone project. After graduation, I continued to work on improving and expanding the site, implementing several features and learning a lot about optimization in the progress (note to self: don't add 200 seeds out of nowhere). Implementing a live chat feature with WebSockets is something I've wanted to do since before writing Ribbit's first line of code, and it's been waiting patiently on my Features To Do list while I worked on the features ahead of it in line.

Last weekend, I found myself in the position to finally give WebSockets and the live chat feature a shot. I worked hard throughout the weekend, my excitement fueling my motivation. It was truly a pleasant surprise that I found myself finishing the feature before the weekend was over.

In this blog post, I'm going to go through the process of duplicating Reddit's live chat feature, from the initial planning process all the way to the end. Please note that this post will *not* include information on the languages and technologies used to build this feature; if you wish to use this blog post to help yourself out in some way, you will most likely need to already have an understanding of the languages and technologies listed below. If, however, you don't have an issue with said languages but you do find yourself struggling to understand how to do things like duplicating an existing feature or figuring out how to model a feature's backend and/or frontend, or if you're just plain interested in reading how I did this, this post may be of use to you.

(Note: I do briefly go over WebSockets - more specifically, `flask-socketio` at some point, so if you are here to learn more about that, it's the one technology I end up covering.)

### Languages and Technologies
* React
* Redux
* Flask
* SQLAlchemy
* Flask-socketio
* React-Router

## Initial Research and Planning
Whenever I begin a new project or feature, I usually spend some time in the planning/research stage. It can be easy to underestimate how important this stage is, but a well thought-out project almost always ends up being simpler to execute with higher-quality code.

Since we're cloning something that already exists, a great place to start is, well, the thing that already exists - in our case, Reddit's live chat feature. For simplicity's sake, I went ahead and captured a gif of me interacting with the chat window. Let's watch this gif and
