## Redux

Before we talk about the crux of this post - the React components - let's briefly go over the Redux code.

In the redux file, `chats.js`, we have the following thunks to pair with our endpoints:

- `getUserChatThreads`
- `getChatThread`
- `createChatThread`
- `createChatMessage`
- `fakeDeleteMessage`
- `readAllMessages`

```javascript
const LOAD_CHAT_THREADS = "chat_threads/LOAD_CHAT_THREADS";
const LOAD_CHAT_THREAD = "chat_threads/LOAD_CHAT_THREAD";

const loadChatThreads = (chatThreads) => {
  return {
    type: LOAD_CHAT_THREADS,
    chatThreads,
  };
};

const loadChatThread = (chatThread) => {
  return {
    type: LOAD_CHAT_THREAD,
    chatThread,
  };
};

export const getUserChatThreads = () => async (dispatch) => {
  const response = await fetch("/api/chat_threads");

  if (response.ok) {
    const data = await response.json();
    dispatch(loadChatThreads(data));
    return data;
  }
};

export const getChatThread = (chatThreadId) => async (dispatch) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/chat_threads/${chatThreadId}`);
  if (response.ok) {
    const data = await response.json();
    dispatch(loadChatThread(data));
    return data;
  }
};

export const createChatThread = (receiverId) => async (dispatch) => {
  const response = await fetch("/api/chat_threads", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ receiverId: receiverId }),
  });

  if (response.ok) {
    const data = await response.json();
    dispatch(loadChatThread(data));
    return data;
  }
};

export const createChatMessage = (payload) => async (dispatch) => {
  const { content, receiverId, chatThreadId } = payload;
  const response = await fetch(`/api/chat_threads/${chatThreadId}/messages`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      content: content,
      receiver_id: receiverId,
    }),
  });

  if (response.ok) {
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } else if (response.status < 500) {
    const data = await response.json();
    if (data.errors) {
      return data;
    }
  } else {
    return ["An error occurred. Please try again."];
  }
};

export const createReaction = (payload) => async (dispatch) => {
  const { emoji, userId, messageId } = payload;

  const response = await fetch(`/api/messages/${messageId}/reactions`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      emoji,
      user_id: userId,
    }),
  });

  if (response.ok) {
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } else if (response.status < 500) {
    const data = await response.json();
    if (data.errors) {
      return data;
    }
  } else {
    return ["An error occurred. Please try again."];
  }
};

export const fakeDeleteMessage = (messageId) => async (dispatch) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/chat_threads/messages/${messageId}`, {
    method: "PUT",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  });

  if (response.ok) {
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  }
};

export const readAllMessages = (threadId) => async (dispatch) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/chat_threads/${threadId}/read`, {
    method: "PUT",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  });

  if (response.ok) {
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  }
};

const initialState = {};

export default function chatThreadReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case LOAD_CHAT_THREADS:
      if (action.chatThreads && action.chatThreads.ChatThreads) {
        return action.chatThreads.ChatThreads.reduce(
          (chatThreads, chatThread) => {
            chatThreads[chatThread.id] = chatThread;
            return chatThreads;
          },
          {}
        );
      }
      return state;

    case LOAD_CHAT_THREAD:
      return { ...state, [action.chatThread.id]: action.chatThread };

    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

## Setting Up the Frontend

We have finally made it to the meat of this feature - the React components that sit in the `src/` file on the frontend. Hooray! Give yourself a knuckle-touch.

### File Structure & Initial Setup

As it stands, our frontend is currently pretty bare, so we need to create some components. Let's go ahead and create a folder structure diagram.

```

Chat/
├─ ChatLeft/
│  ├─ ChatLeft.js
│  ├─ ChatNav.js
│  └─ ChatNavBtn.js
│
├─ ChatRight/
│  ├─ ChatRight.js
│  ├─ ChatTitleBar.js
│  │
│  ├─ ChatInput/
│  │  ├─ ChatInput.js
│  │  └─ ChatEmojis.js
│  │
│  ├─ ChatMessages/
│  │  ├─ ChatMessages.js
│  │  └─ ChatMessage.js
│  │
├─ ChatOverlays/
│  ├─ WelcomeOverlay.js
│  ├─ NewChatOverlay.js
│  ├─ InviteOverlay.js
│  └─ DeleteMsgOverlay.js
│
├─ Chat.js
└─ Chat.css
```

We start with our overall folder, `Chat` - specifically our main component, `Chat.js`.

The chat window is divided into two main parts - the left side and the right side - so we decided to structure the folders like that by creating a `ChatLeft/` folder and a `ChatRight/` folder. We also have `ChatOverlays` to hold the handful of overlays we need. Since these overlays are absolutely positioned, they aren't necessarily in the `ChatRight` group, and we can keep them in a general place instread.

Create all of these files and folders before we move on. As you create each file, take a moment to create the React function and its container div. Here, we do it for `Chat.js`, `ChatLeft.js`, and `ChatNav.js`. Do the same for the right side and the overlays.

```javascript
// Chat.js
import React from "react";
import ChatLeft from "./ChatLeft/ChatLeft";
import ChatRight from "./ChatRight/ChatRight";

const Chat = () => {
  return (
    <div className="chat-container">
      <ChatLeft />
      <ChatRight />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Chat;
```

```javascript
// ChatLeft.js
import ChatNav from "./ChatNav";

const ChatLeft = () => {
  return (
    <div className="chat-left-container">
      <ChatNav />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ChatLeft;
```

```javascript
// ChatNav.js
import ChatNavBtn from "./ChatNavBtn";

const ChatNav = () => {
  return <div className="chat-nav-container"></div>;
};

export default ChatNav;
```

Note that for `ChatNav`, we import ChatNavBtn and leave it for now. Since we'll be mapping to that component, we don't need it just yet.

Once all of the files are set up, we can move on to initial styling.

### Initial Styling

It's hard to manually test a feature if it doesn't exist physically, so we need to set up some basic styling including the chat window's layout, the general size of each component, giving the feature a background, etc.

```css
.chat-container {
  width: 632px;
  height: 506px;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 1.875rem;
  border-radius: 1rem 1rem 0 0;
  box-shadow: 0 0.125em 0.75em 0.125em rgba(20, 120, 120, 0.11);
  top: auto;
  position: fixed;
  overflow: hidden;
  background: white;
  z-index: 9999;
  border: 1px solid #edeff1;
  border-bottom: none;
  font-family: system-ui, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif,
    "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol";
  display: flex;
}
```

This is all of the css we'll need for `.chat-container`, and results in this:

<center>

![](../initial-styling.png)

</center>

It also gives it the correct placement on the page, as seen here:

![](../initial-styling1.png)

:::info Regarding the font family used in `.chat-container`

```css
font-family: system-ui, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif,
  "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol";
```

This is known as a **native font stack** or **system font stack**. It essentially uses the operating system's default system font, accounting for all of the major operating systems used today (macOS, Windows, Android, Ubuntu). Using this can help boost performance because the browser doesn't have to download any font files since it's using one it already had.

Reddit actually uses

```css
font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto,
  "Helvetica Neue", Arial, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji",
  "Segoe UI Symbol", sans-serif;
```

However, according to a [thorough write-up](https://css-tricks.com/implementing-system-fonts-booking-com%E2%80%8A-%E2%80%8Aa-lesson-learned/) published by Booking.com, using snippets starting with `-apple-system` may cause some browsers to view the leading font as a vendor prefix that will be ignored.

Chrome and Safari recently shipped "system-ui", which is a generic font family that can be used in place of `-apple-system` and `BlinkMacSystemFont`, and is the font family we're using today.
:::

Follow this by adding the following css code:

```css
.chat-left-container {
  height: 100%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
  border-right: 1px solid #edeff1;
  max-width: 220px;
  width: 100%;
}

.chat-right-container {
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.chat-nav-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  overflow-y: auto;
}

.chat-messages-container {
  overflow: hidden auto;
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  flex: 1 0 0px;
}

.chat-input-container {
  padding: 8px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  position: relative;
}
```

After applying this code, our chat component looks like this:

<center>

![](./../initial-styling2.png)

</center>

As you can see, this successfully lays out our components and makes sure they're all of the correct size and placement. The component names have been left in to accurately show where our components are, but you don't necessarily need to leave them in yourself.

## Coding the Frontend: Chat Access & Doing the Overlays

It's time to start coding our frontend components. We may as well begin where the user begins: Opening the chat component.

On Reddit, there are two ways to access Chat - via a button in the top navbar, and via the 'Chat' button on user profile pages, both shown here:

<center>

<figure>

![](../chatnav-btn.png)<figcaption><em>The chat button located in the top navbar</em></figcaption>

</figure>

<figure>

![](../profile-chat-btn.png)<figcaption><em>The chat button located on a user's profile page</em></figcaption>

</figure>
</center>

Since we know that we're going to need two access points that are in two completely different components, we need to create the relevant state variables in a place that can reach both components. For Ribbit, that would be all the way back in `App.js`, in which we add this code:

```javascript
const [openChat, setOpenChat] = useState(false);
const [selectedChat, setSelectedChat] = useState(chatThreads[0]);

// ...

return (
  // ...

  {openChat && (
    <Chat
      openChat={openChat}
      setOpenChat={setOpenChat}
      setSelectedChat={setSelectedChat}
      selectedChat={selectedChat}
    />
  )}

  // ...
)
```

Now, when `openChat` is `true`, our `Chat` component will appear.

Also included is the `selectedChat` state variable, which represents the chat thread currently active in the chat window.

:::info Not shown:

Not shown in the above code are the `NavBar` and `UserProfile` components, to which our state variables are also passed.

:::

### NavBar Button

First, let's check out the functionality of the navbar button. When clicked, the chat window opens either to the most recently updated chat thread, or, if no chat threads exist, to the "Welcome" overlay:

<center>

![](../welcome-overlay.png)

</center>

This is something to keep in mind when we work on the button's functionality.

Moving on to creating the actual button, let's take another look at the screenshot from earlier:

<center>

![](../chatnav-btn.png)

</center>

Reddit has given the button an icon that looks like a chat bubble with 3 dots inside. Let's try to find that icon or something similar.

:::note Finding Icons
When it comes to finding an icon, I personally don't like to deviate from using the [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) library, because doing so usually requires downloading the image instead of simply importing it from the library.

If I really can't find anything close on react-icons, I'll typically try either [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com) or [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/).
:::

In this case, I used [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons) library to find the icon I needed (re: chat bubble with 3 dots inside).

In the `NavBar` component, the icon is placed into a `button` element, and we add a click event that points to a function we'll call `handleOpenChat`.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { BsChatDots } from "react-icons/bs";

// Other import statements go here

const NavBar = ({ setOpenChat, OpenChat, setSelectedChat }) => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const chatThreads = useSelector((state) => state.chatThreads);
  const [showTooltip, setShowTooltip] = useState(false);

  // Sorts the threads in the chatThreads array so that the chat thread with the latest message sent is set as the most recent one, aka the thread at the top of the chat navigation.
  const sortedThreads = Object.values(chatThreads).sort((a, b) => {
    const aMessages = a.messages;
    const bMessages = b.messages;
    if (aMessages && bMessages) {
      const aLastMessage = aMessages[aMessages?.length - 1];
      const bLastMessage = bMessages[bMessages?.length - 1];

      if (aMessages?.length === 0 && bMessages?.length === 0) {
        return a.createdAt.localeCompare(b.createdAt);
      }

      if (aMessages?.length === 0) {
        return 1;
      }

      if (bMessages?.length === 0) {
        return -1;
      }

      return (
        new Date(bLastMessage.createdAt) - new Date(aLastMessage.createdAt)
      );
    }
  });

  const handleOpenChat = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    setSelectedChat(sortedThreads[0]);
    setOpenChat(!openChat);
  };

  // ...

  return (
    // ...

    <button
      className="navbar-button"
      onMouseEnter={() => setTimeout(() => setShowTooltip(true), 500)}
      onMouseLeave={() => setShowTooltip(false)}
      onClick={handleOpenChat}
    >
      <BsChatDots />
      {showTooltip && <span className="navbtn-tooltiptext">Chat</span>}
    </button>

    // ...
  );
};
```

Since this is fairly long, let's break it up and talk about each part individually.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { BsChatDots } from "react-icons/bs";
```

These are our import statements. We import the `useState` hook from `react`, and `useDispatch` and `useSelector` from react-redux. We also grab the icon needed for the chat button from `react-icons`.

```javascript
const NavBar = ({ setOpenChat, openChat, setSelectedChat }) => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const chatThreads = useSelector((state) => state.chatThreads);
  const [showTooltip, setShowTooltip] = useState(false);

  // ...
};
```

Next, we create the `NavBar` component, making sure to import the `setOpenChat`, `openChat`, and `setSelectedChat` props. We use the `useDispatch()` hook (giving it the `dispatch` variable), followed by setting the variable `chatThreads` to the chat threads in the redux state, which we grabbed via `useSelector`.

We also create the `showTooltip` state variable, though this is optional.

```javascript
// Sorts the threads in the chatThreads array so that the chat thread with the latest message sent is set as the most recent one, aka the thread at the top of the chat navigation.
const sortedThreads = Object.values(chatThreads).sort((a, b) => {
  const aMessages = a.messages;
  const bMessages = b.messages;
  if (aMessages && bMessages) {
    const aLastMessage = aMessages[aMessages?.length - 1];
    const bLastMessage = bMessages[bMessages?.length - 1];

    if (aMessages?.length === 0 && bMessages?.length === 0) {
      return a.createdAt.localeCompare(b.createdAt);
    }

    if (aMessages?.length === 0) {
      return 1;
    }

    if (bMessages?.length === 0) {
      return -1;
    }

    return new Date(bLastMessage.createdAt) - new Date(aLastMessage.createdAt);
  }
});
```

Here, we have a long code block for `sortedThreads`, which is the array of chat threads, but sorted by when the latest message was sent.

As far as the `handleOpenChat` function, we keep it fairly simple.

```javascript
const handleOpenChat = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  setSelectedChat(sortedThreads[0]);
  setOpenChat(!openChat);
};
```

With our chat threads sorted by latest message sent, we set the selected chat to the first item in the list, which will be the top thread in the chat navigation. We also `setOpenChat` to whatever the opposite of `openChat`'s current state is, so that clicking the button both opens and closes the chat window.

Finally, we have our actual button in the JSX code.

```jsx
<button
  className="navbar-button"
  onMouseEnter={() => setTimeout(() => setShowTooltip(true), 500)}
  onMouseLeave={() => setShowTooltip(false)}
  onClick={handleOpenChat}
>
  <BsChatDots />
  {showTooltip && <span className="navbtn-tooltiptext">Chat</span>}
</button>
```

We set the button's `onClick` event to our `handleOpenChat` function and set our chosen icon as the button's contents.

:::note The button's tooltip

Included in the above code is the code that handles the button's tooltip, which can be seen in the screenshot of the navbar's chat button.

1. Hanging out near the top of the inside of the `NavBar` component is this state variable:

   ```javascript
   const [showTooltip, setShowTooltip] = useState(false);
   ```

2. We give our "button" (a simple `div` element instead of an actual `button` element) three events, two of which are `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave`:

   ```javascript
   onMouseEnter={() => setTimeout(() => setShowTooltip(true), 500)}
   onMouseLeave={() => setShowTooltip(false)}
   ```

   When the mouse enters the chat button, we set a timeout that shows the tooltip after a half second (500 milliseconds). When the mouse leaves the chat button, we close the tooltip.

3. Inside of the button is the tooltip itself:

   ```javascript
   {
     showTooltip && <span className="navbtn-tooltiptext">Chat</span>;
   }
   ```

   So, when `showTooltip` is `true`, the tooltip, which says "Chat", appears.

:::

And that's all there is to this button. The most important parts are the `setOpenChat` and `setSelectedChat` props, which handle the chat window's visibility and the thread that opens with it, respectively.

### Testing
