# A Day in My Life as a Junior Software Engineer: Navigating Job Search, Skill Development, and Project Work

## Introduction

We are nearing the end of May, and as June begins, so marks the start of the fourth month of my job search.

I was thinking about the software engineering industry today, and about how unemployed engineers have it a bit rougher than those from other industries. Perhaps it's my inexperience talking, but I can't think of any other industry that requires you to be so busy during the job searching process. Not only do you have to do the usual activities (researching companies, filling out applications, customizing resumes and cover letters, outreach and networking), but on top of all of that, you also have to study DS&A because your interviews are more likely to have DS&A questions than not, study languages and technologies you already know to keep up on the knowledge, study languages and technologies you DON'T already know to keep up with the ever-evolving industry, and work on projects in an effort to remain competitive in a packed industry full of potential talent.

As a result, being unemployed is a far cry from taking any sort of break; on the contrary, I may be even busier than I would be if I had a job. Today I'm going to get into the day in the life of an unemployed junior software engineer and share the schedule I try to keep in the hopes of breaking into the industry.

### Daily Schedule

<hr />
<b>I. Morning Warm-Up Activities</b>

To start my day, I spend around 30 minutes waking up my brain. I check my emails and social media accounts, and browse various sites to stay updated with the latest industry news. This routine helps me stay connected and informed, which is ever vital in an industry that requires constant learning.

<hr />
<b>2. Job-Searching Activities</b>

Immediately following my morning warm-up is an hour of job-searching activities. As a junior software engineer, job searching requires strategic efforts. I search for relevant positions, tailor my applications to highlight my skills, and reach out to potential employers. Staying proactive in the job search is crucial to securing opportunities due to the highly competitive nature of the software engineering industry.

#### DS&A Studies

The software engineering field heavily relies on strong foundations in DS&A. I dedicate an hour each day to studying related concepts. For example, I am currently focusing on expanding my knowledge of linked lists. I delve into specific concepts ,analyze their implementations, and explore various use cases. My favorite resources are pdf files found on Google. It's an easy way to find textbooks for free when normally they might cost hundreds of dollars. I also utilize Codecademy, for which I have a year's subscription.

#### IV. DS&A Practice

To solidify my understanding of DS&A, I spend the next hour practicing what I learned the previous hour through coding exercises and challenges. Platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank offer a plethora of problems to solve, but I especially like Structy for its inclusion of helpful explanation videos. Regular practice sharpens my problem-solving skills, strengthens my algorithmic thinking, and prepares me for technical interviews by keeping the knowledge fresh in my mind.

#### V. Learning and Practicing a New Language/Framework/Technology

I allocate an hour each day to learning and practicing a new language, framework, or technology. Currently, I am trying to learn TypeScript, especially in regards to using it with React. In general, I achieve these studies largely through Codecademy and online textbook pdf files, but I wouldn't actually learn anything if I didn't utilize my learning via building small projects and completing related exercises and challenges.

#### VI. Existing Projects

A substantial portion of my day, around 2 hours (sometimes more), is dedicated to working on existing projects. I am currently focused on Ribbit, my pixel-perfect Reddit clone, for which I am focusing on implementing new features, improving functionality, irradicating bugs, and enhancing the quality of my code in general. Not only do I really enjoy doing this, but it also helps me continue to improve my portfolio in the hopes of impressing recruiters or hiring managers enough to land some interviews.

#### VII. Job-Searching Activities, Part 2

Near the end of my "work day" is yet another hour of job-searching activities. This includes following up with potential employers, conducing in-depth research on companies, staying active in the software engineering community, and continuing my efforts to fill out quality applications.

#### VIII. End-of-day activities

In the final 30 minutes of my day, I wind down by repeating my warm-up activities - I check my email and social media accounts to ensure that I haven't missed any messages, and I check my favorite news sites once more to see what's happened during the day. What's especially important during these times is maintaining a positive mindset mind, which means maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Regardless of how much I truly enjoy software engineering-related activities, I have been forcing myself to "clock off" when it is time so I can spend the rest of my evening with family, playing video games, doing chores, and running errands. Prioritizing self-care, relaxation, and pursuing hobbies helps recharge me for the next day.
