# A Day in the Life of an Unemployed Software Engineer

As June comes to a close and July begins, I enter the 4th month of my job search.

Software engineering is an industry that can be as difficult as it is fulfilling, even before you've managed to land a job. I spend more hours than I would working a full-time job to ensure I remain a competitive job candidate. On top of studying Data Structures and Algorithms due to the likelihood of needing to answer leetcode-style questions, I also have to keep up on evolving trends in the industry, continuously work on learning everything you don't know (plus honing your skills in languages and technologies you DO know), and work on projects, both new and old. All of this takes time.

On top of this, job listings are regularly asking entry-level engineers to have several years worth of professional experience and a list of required languages and technologies so long, it damn near reaches the moon.

I am as passionate as ever about software engineering, and I love to learn, so none of this is a real problem for me. However, other unemployed software engineers are getting exhausted and burnt out, and I feel for them.

Every day, I do my best to follow this schedule:

### Daily Schedule

<hr />
<b>I. Morning Warm-Up Activities</b>

To start my day, I spend around 30 minutes waking up my brain. I check my emails and social media accounts, and browse various sites to stay updated with the latest industry news. This routine helps me stay connected and informed, which is ever vital in an industry that requires constant learning.

<hr />
<b>2. Job-Searching Activities</b>

Immediately following my morning warm-up is an hour of job-searching activities. As a junior software engineer, job searching requires strategic efforts. I search for relevant positions, tailor my applications to highlight my skills, and reach out to potential employers. Staying proactive in the job search is crucial to securing opportunities due to the highly competitive nature of the software engineering industry.

<hr />
#### DS&A Studies

The software engineering field heavily relies on strong foundations in DS&A. I dedicate an hour each day to studying related concepts. For example, I am currently focusing on expanding my knowledge of linked lists. I delve into specific concepts ,analyze their implementations, and explore various use cases. My favorite resources are pdf files found on Google. It's an easy way to find textbooks for free when normally they might cost hundreds of dollars. I also utilize Codecademy, for which I have a year's subscription.

#### IV. DS&A Practice

To solidify my understanding of DS&A, I spend the next hour practicing what I learned the previous hour through coding exercises and challenges. Platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank offer a plethora of problems to solve, but I especially like Structy for its inclusion of helpful explanation videos. Regular practice sharpens my problem-solving skills, strengthens my algorithmic thinking, and prepares me for technical interviews by keeping the knowledge fresh in my mind.

#### V. Learning and Practicing a New Language/Framework/Technology

I allocate an hour each day to learning and practicing a new language, framework, or technology. Currently, I am trying to learn TypeScript, especially in regards to using it with React. In general, I achieve these studies largely through Codecademy and online textbook pdf files, but I wouldn't actually learn anything if I didn't utilize my learning via building small projects and completing related exercises and challenges.

#### VI. Existing Projects

A substantial portion of my day, around 2 hours (sometimes more), is dedicated to working on existing projects. I am currently focused on Ribbit, my pixel-perfect Reddit clone, for which I am focusing on implementing new features, improving functionality, irradicating bugs, and enhancing the quality of my code in general. Not only do I really enjoy doing this, but it also helps me continue to improve my portfolio in the hopes of impressing recruiters or hiring managers enough to land some interviews.

#### VII. Job-Searching Activities, Part 2

Near the end of my "work day" is yet another hour of job-searching activities. This includes following up with potential employers, conducing in-depth research on companies, staying active in the software engineering community, and continuing my efforts to fill out quality applications.

#### VIII. End-of-day activities

In the final 30 minutes of my day, I wind down by repeating my warm-up activities - I check my email and social media accounts to ensure that I haven't missed any messages, and I check my favorite news sites once more to see what's happened during the day. What's especially important during these times is maintaining a positive mindset mind, which means maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Regardless of how much I truly enjoy software engineering-related activities, I have been forcing myself to "clock off" when it is time so I can spend the rest of my evening with family, playing video games, doing chores, and running errands. Prioritizing self-care, relaxation, and pursuing hobbies helps recharge me for the next day.
