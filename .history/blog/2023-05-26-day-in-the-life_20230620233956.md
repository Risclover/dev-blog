# A Day in the Life of an Unemployed Software Engineer

As June comes to a close and July begins, I enter the 4th month of my job search.

Software engineering is an industry that can be as difficult as it is fulfilling, even before you've managed to land a job. I spend more hours than I would working a full-time job to ensure I remain a competitive job candidate. On top of studying Data Structures and Algorithms due to the likelihood of needing to answer leetcode-style questions, I also have to keep up on evolving trends in the industry, continuously work on learning everything you don't know (plus honing your skills in languages and technologies you DO know), and work on projects, both new and old. All of this takes time.

On top of this, job listings are regularly asking entry-level engineers to have several years worth of professional experience and a list of required languages and technologies so long, it damn near reaches the moon.

I am as passionate as ever about software engineering, and I love to learn, so none of this is a real problem for me. However, other unemployed software engineers are getting exhausted and burnt out, and I feel for them.

Every day, I do my best to follow this schedule:
