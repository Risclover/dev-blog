Welcome to Musings of a Software Engineer! I'm Sara, your hostess for the evening and the voice behind this blog.

This space is all about my adventures as a software engineer. I'll be sharing my thoughts, experiences, and insights on everything related to the world of coding. From my day-to-day projects to my takes on the latest trends, I aim to cover it all.

I'm a software engineer from sunny California. Over the years, I've developed a serious passion for software engineering. When I realized that I had developed this passion, I was overjoyed; Finally, I had found my true calling, and the idea that I can get paid for doing what I love is an absolute dream.

Once I knew I wanted to take my interest in the field seriously, my journey began with frontend engineering. After a year of self-study, diving into various frontend languages and technologies, I took a leap and enrolled in App Academy for fullstack training. Graduating in February was a major milestone, and now I'm eagerly seeking job opportunities while doing my best to both hone my existing skills and gain new ones.

In my spare time, you'll most likely find me glued to my computer, either studying and expanding my knowledge or working on some sort of project. These days, my focus revolves around Ribbit, my pixel-perfect Reddit clone, and delving into the realm of TypeScript with React. Additionally, I make it a priority to deepen my understanding of Data Structures & Algorithms, both to ace potential technical interviews and to continuously grow as a developer.

I'm a friendly soul who's always up for a chat. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or simply want to share your thoughts; I promise I won't bite. In the meantime, I hope you enjoy reading the Musings of a Software Engineer!
