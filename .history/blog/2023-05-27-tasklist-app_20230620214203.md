# Redoing 'Tasklist App' - A Comparison Between Then and Now

As June comes to a close and July begins, I enter the 4th month of my job search.

Software engineering is an industry that can be as difficult as it is fulfilling, even before you've managed to land a software engineering job. I spend more hours than I would working a full-time job to ensure I remain a competitive job candidate. Of course, you have to study Data Structures and Algorithms so you can solve any potential related technical questions, but you also have to keep up on evolving trends in the industry, continuously work on learning, and work on projects (new and/or old).

As a result, almost every day, I do my best to follow this schedule:

## Initial Plans

For my new tasklist app, I'm going to include a backend as well as a frontend. My plan is to make it a legitimate app that people can use, which means users can sign up for their own accounts, and data will be going to an actual database instead of relying on LocalStorage.

### Tech Stack

I really enjoy using both Express and Flask, but I think for this project I'm going to go with Flask. So my tech stack, as of now, includes:

- React (TypeScript)
- Redux
- Flask (Python)
- Sqlalchemy
- React Testing Library
- Jest

### Database Schema Diagram

Since I'm going to be making this a fullstack app, I need to consider my database schema. For now, this is what I have come up with. We have a table for users, a table for projects, and a table for tasks.

#### Users

- `username` - the user's username
- `password` - the user's password
- `email` - the user's email address

#### Projects

- `user_id` - Each project will belong to a specific user, which is how we will identify which tasks belong to a user as well (because tasks must belong to a project).
- `title` - Projects must have a title, with a max of 20 characters.

#### Tasks

- `project_id` - Each task will belong to a specific project.
- `title` - The task itself.
- `description` - (called 'Notes' in the original app) The user can (optionally) use this to include additional information.
- `due_date` - The user can optionally set a due date.
- `important` - A boolean for whether or not the task is marked as 'important'.
- `completed` - A boolean for whether or not the task is marked as 'completed'.
- `priority` - (not included in the image) The level of priority the user has given the task.

### Tentative Extras

When I built the original app, I had plans to include more features than what I ended up with. More specifically, I really wanted to allow the user to select a **theme** and an **icon** for each project. I also was considering the inclusion of **subtasks** (tasks for each task, essentially).

If it isn't apparent yet, allow me to be transparent: I was modeling my app after Microsoft's To-Do app, which, when you know to compare the two, becomes somewhat obvious, what with how mine is laid out compared to Microsoft's. Anyway, since their app included themes, icons, and subtasks, I wanted mine to as well, not just for the sake of copying them but because I liked the ideas and I'm always down to make my apps feel as complete as possible.
