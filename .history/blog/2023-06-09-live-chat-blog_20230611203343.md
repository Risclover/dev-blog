# Live Chat Blog

I attended App Academy. Before graduation, students are required to submit and present a capstone project, which is a fullstack web application that is meant to showcase your newfound skills as a software engineer. My capstone project was a pixel-perfect clone of Reddit that I named 'Ribbit'.

After graduation, I continued to enhance Ribbit, and implementing a live chat feature using WebSockets was one of the exciting additions on my to-do list. Recently, I finally found myself in the position to tackle this feature and was successful, so I decided to share my experience with you. From initial reseasrch and planning to implementation, I will guide you through the steps involved in duplicating an existing feature. Please note that this blog post assumes a basic understanding of the languages and technologies used in the project, which include React, Redux, Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, and React-Router. However, the project also uses flask-socketio, which I will be going into detail about.

## Initial Research and Planning

Before diving into any project, it is crucial to spend time on research and planning. This stage sets the foundation for a successful implementation and ensures high-quality code. In this case, I started by thoroughly examining Reddit's live chat feature, paying attention to its functionality and user experience.

To illustrate the feature's intricacies, I created a GIF demonstrating its different aspects. Let's take a closer look and identify the key elements:

Some noteworthy observations:

- The chat window consists of two main sections: the left side containing chat navigation and a "Create Chat" button, and the right side displaying the chat thread title, messages, and an input box.
- Chat navigation buttons provide relevant information such as the other user's image, username, the last message's content, the time it was sent, and the sender (either the other user's username or "You").
- Instead of displaying emoji stickers, the last message shows a picture emoji (üñºÔ∏è).
- Messages are grouped by date, with messages sent more than a day ago displaying the abbreviated date, and messages sent yesterday or today labeled as such.
- Each chat thread begins with an area containing the other user's image, username, karma count, and the number of days they have been on the site.

- When a user sends multiple messages in a row within a minute, they are grouped together, omitting redundant information.
- Hovering over a grouped message reveals the time it was sent.
- Each message has buttons that appear on hover, allowing reactions or specific actions like deleting or reporting a message.
- Deleting a message updates its content to "[message deleted]" and changes the text color to light gray.

- Clicking the "Create Chat" button opens a "New Chat" overlay where users can search and select other users to start a chat.
- The input box expands to show four lines and then allows scrolling.

- When users without any existing chat threads open the chat feature, they see a "Welcome" overlay with a "Start new chat" button that leads to the "New Chat" overlay when clicked.

By studying these details, we gain a comprehensive understanding of the feature and can ensure a faithful recreation.

## Backend: Models and Routes

When working on a full-stack project, I prefer starting with the backend and then proceeding to the frontend. This approach minimizes the need to switch back and forth between the two and ensures smoother development. Although some backend adjustments may be necessary later, completing most of the backend work upfront allows me to focus solely on the frontend when the time comes.

### Models

To begin, let's consider the necessary database tables based on user actions:

1. Creating a new chat thread by clicking the "Create Chat" button.
2. Sending messages through the input box.
3. Clicking on a chat navigation button to open the respective thread.
4. "Deleting" a message by updating its content.

All interactions are with either the chat threads themselves or with messages, which makes it clear that we need to include two models: `ChatThread` and `ChatMessage`.

In addition, we have a many-to-many relationship between users and chat threads (chat threads can have many users, and users can have many chat threads), so we'll need an association table that we'll call `user_chat_threads`.

As a quick side note, some of the code snippets in this blog post have an import statement at the top that says `from .db import db`. To clear up any potential confusion, this is referring to the `db.py` file, which holds the following code:

```python
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
import os
environment = os.getenv("FLASK_ENV")
db = SQLAlchemy()
```

Let's begin with the `user_chat_threads` table to establish the relationship between users and chat threads:

```python
from .db import db

user_chat_threads = db.Table('user_chat_threads',
  db.Model.metadata,
  db.Column('user_id', db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('users.id'), primary_key=True),
  db.Column('chat_thread_id', db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('chat_message_threads.id'), primary_key=True),
)
```

Next, we have the `ChatThread` model to represent a chat thread between two users.

```python
from .db import db

# ...

class ChatThread(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "chat_threads"

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, server_default.db.func.now())
    messages = db.relationship('ChatMessage', back_populates='chat_message_thread', cascade='all, delete')
    chat_thread_users = db.relationship('User', back_populates='chat_threads', secondary=user_chat_threads, lazy='joined')
```

- `id` - Primary key for the chat thread
- `created_at` - Timestamp indicating when the chat thread was created
- `messages` - One-to-many relationship with the `ChatMessage` model to represent the messages in the thread. `cascade='all, delete'` ensures that when the chat thread is deleted, its messages get deleted, too.
- `chat_thread_users` - Many-to-many relationship with the `User` model to associate the users participating in the chat thread. Note the user of the `secondary` argument, which associates the `user_chat_threads` table.

Finally, we have the `ChatMessage` model:

```python
from .db import db

# ...

class ChatMessage(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "chat_messages"

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    sender_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('users.id', ondelete="CASCADE"), nullable=False)
    receiver_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("users.id"), nullable=False)
    content = db.Column(db.String(10000), nullable=False)
    thread_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("chat_message_threads.id"), unique=False, nullable=False)
    read = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False, nullable=False)
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, server_default=db.func.now())

    chat_message_thread = db.relationship('ChatMessageThread', back_populates="messages")
    sender = db.relationship("User", back_populates="user_chat_messages", primaryjoin="User.id==ChatMessage.sender_id")
    recipient = db.relationship("User", primaryjoin="User.id==ChatMessage.receiver_id")
```

* `id` - Primary key for the chat message.
* `sender_id` - The user id for user sending the message.
* `receiver_id` - The user id for the user receiving the message.
* `content` - The content of the message.
* `
